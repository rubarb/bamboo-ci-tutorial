Integrating tests with the Jenkins Sauce OnDemand plugin
=============

To run the tests, go the Bamboo dashboard. The plan wasn't enabled when we it was created, so click the `Enable plan` image.

![Enable plan](##enable-plan.png##)

Once the plan has been enabled, click the `Run` image.

![Run plan](##run-plan.png##)

This should compile and run three tests.

Once the build has finished, navigate to the Build Summary page.
